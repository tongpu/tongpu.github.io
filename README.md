# Lukas Grossar's blog

This is using GitHub pages and Hugo to allow me to finally find the motivation to blog.
You can either subscribe to the RSS generated by Hugo on the blog or to changes in the repo via GitHub.

If you spot a mistake or want to fix something, fork the project and submit a PR.

## Build

In the project root run `hugo` to build into the `public` directory, or run `hugo server` to run a local server which autorefreshes on source file changes.
